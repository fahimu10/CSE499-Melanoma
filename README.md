# Melanoma Detection Using Deep Learning (DL)

## Abstract
Melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer that begins in cells known as melanocytes. Melanoma is more dangerous because of its ability to spread to other organs more rapidly if it is not treated at an early stage. Melanoma present in many different shapes, sizes and colors. That’s why it’s tricky to provide a comprehensive set of warning signs. Melanoma is usually curable when detected and treated early. Once melanoma has spread deeper into the skin or other parts of the body, it becomes more difficult to treat and can be deadly. While curable with early detection, only highly trained specialists are capable of accurately recognizing the disease. So, we propose a system that combines recent developments in deep learning with established machine learning approaches, creating ensembles of methods that are capable of segmenting skin lesions, as well as analyzing the detected area and surrounding tissue for melanoma detection. In this paper, we propose a method for classifying melanoma images into benign and malignant using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).Classifying melanoma from dermoscopic images is now a current trend in AI based skin cancer detection methods but prerequisite is highly computation tools which take much time, effort and cost as well. In these cases, researchers train a huge number of images with 'Deep Learning' algorithms, basically with pretty deep neural architectures containing a huge number of parameters to train with, though they got their expected outcomes. In our research, we emphasized on building models with less complexity and comparatively better accuracy, so that melanoma can be identified with ease.
## Method
ResNet 50 architecture was re-trained on our dataset by fine-tuning across all layers and replacing top layers with one average pooling, one fully connected. Finally, the softmax layer allows the classification of 2 diagnostic categories. The input images’ size was all resized to (224, 224) to be compatible with this model. The learning rate was set to 0.0001 and Adam was used for the optimizer. It uses identity mapping to map the inputs. This identity mapping does not have any parameters and is just there to add the output from the previous layer to the layer ahead. The identity mapping is multiplied by a linear projection to expand shortcuts’ channels to match the residual. The Skip Connections between layers add the outputs from previous layers to the outputs of stacked layers. This results in the ability to train much deeper networks than what was previously possible.
## Dataset
We obtained a public dataset from the ISIC website for skin cancer classification. We used the ISIC Archive Downloader to download the images. We will use 70% images for training and 30% images for testing of size 224*224 pixels.
